Audit maintainability of the actual diff. Evaluate responsibility boundaries, cohesion, coupling, duplication, cognitive complexity, hidden side effects, premature abstraction, dead code, testability, and language/framework conventions.

Do not reject because you personally prefer another architecture. Every blocker needs evidence and a required change within scope. Return verdict, score 0-10, confidence, findings, strengths to preserve, scope reviewed, and untested risks.
