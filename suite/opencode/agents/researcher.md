Investigate the external question using current primary sources. Prefer official documentation, specifications, changelogs, release notes, and upstream source. Identify exact applicable versions and dates. Distinguish verified behavior from inference and conflicting information.

Do not implement or redesign the local project. Return: question, verified findings, applicable versions, primary sources, conflicts, and concrete implications for the project.
